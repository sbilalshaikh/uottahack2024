<h1>Submission for UOttaHack6!</h1>

## DEVPOST
Check out our [devpost](https://devpost.com/software/communiplant) for a demo ðŸ˜‰

Welcome to ComuniPlant!!!
<h2>Our goals</h2>
ComuniPlant aims to build pride in sustainability within your own community! 
<h2>What is ComuniPlant?</h2>
We provide a heatmap of local neighbourhoods in Ottawa and use computer vision with satellite imagery to detect percentage of folliage for your neighbourhood.
After clicking on a neighbourhood we then provide you with your very own community page! Each community page will display your folliage percentage (NVDI) and compare you with the folliage percentage of Ottawa and the world. ComuniPlant provides neighbourhoods with a page where they can upload eco-events going on in their neighbourhoods. 

ComuniPlant provides a neighbourhood flower gallery! Users can upload pictures of flowers in their neighbourhood and with Amazon Rekognition, we use Computer Vision to classify the species of flower that you have found!

<h2>Challenges</h2>
- Amazon Rekognition setup with Python <br>
- Embedding GeoJSON with our maps <br>
- Creating a heatmap <br>
- Complex querries to our database to present information on our map <br>

<h2>Results!</h2>
Won second in UOttaHack, it was Hasith and Methira's first Hackathon, and Bilal's second hackathon, so we were all really proud of our achievements and look forward for the future.
